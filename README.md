# Emotional Awareness Game

A collection of mini-games designed to help people become more aware of their emotions and learn to sit with uncomfortable feelings instead of immediately trying to "fix" them.

## Overview

This project contains ten mini-games, each focused on a different emotional experience:

1. **Boredom** - Arrange colored caps on matching pens
2. **Anxiety** - Manage constantly appearing timers
3. **Guilt** - Care for a plant that wilts regardless of your choices
4. **Self Hate** - Experience intrusive thoughts that keep reappearing
5. **Depression** - Navigate through an increasingly dark world
6. **Meaninglessness** - Build structures that disappear without warning
7. **Addiction** - Experience diminishing pleasure with increasing side effects
8. **Loneliness** - Try to connect with figures that always remain out of reach
9. **Self Compassion** - Learn kindness when struggling with a difficult task
10. **Overwhelmed** - Attempt to manage multiple simultaneous tasks

## How to Play

1. From the main menu, click on any emotion to begin that mini-game
2. Each game has its own simple mechanics designed to evoke the target emotion
3. The goal is not to "win" but to stay present with the feelings that arise
4. Text prompts guide you to notice physical sensations and thoughts
5. Click the "Back" button to return to the main menu at any time

## Philosophy

This game is built around the concept that difficult emotions aren't problems to be solved, but experiences to be felt. By deliberately creating simple game mechanics that mirror emotional experiences, players can practice:

- Noticing physical sensations associated with emotions
- Observing thoughts without immediately reacting
- Developing tolerance for uncomfortable feelings
- Recognizing patterns of avoidance and resistance

## Technical Details

Built using Godot 4.x, this project uses:
- GDScript for all game logic
- Custom shaders for visual effects
- Dynamic UI scaling for different screen sizes
- Procedurally generated game elements

## Future Plans

- Add sound effects and ambient audio for each emotional state
- Include an introductory tutorial
- Add a journal feature to record observations
- Create additional emotions to explore
- Implement accessibility options
